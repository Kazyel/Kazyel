Yo! I'm Mateus, also known as Kazyel, a current Computer Science student and Front/Back-end enthusiast. I also want, somewhere in the future, start learning gaming development as well as cybersecurity. Today, i'm very happy working with ReactJS, NodeJS, Javascript, HTML, CSS, PHP and just a little bit of Java for now.

My love with programming started since I was a kid, always got fascinated about everything the computer and the internet could provide to us. This passion put together with my incessant will to solve problems, there would be no way to have doubts that this was my purpose, to be a developer.
