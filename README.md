<h4 align="center"> Yo! I'm Mateus Mascarelo, also known by the pseudonym of Kazyel, a current Computer Science student and Front-end enthusiast.</h4>

> <p align="justify">Nowadays, i'm very happy working with frameworks like <b>React/Next.js</b>, using <b>Javascript</b> while learning more about <b>Typescript</b> as possible. But I also know something or other about <b>Java</b> and <b>Python</b>, since these languages are primarily used in my university. <br><br>For stylization, I love working with extensions/frameworks of CSS like <b>SASS</b>, <b>TailwindCSS</b> and <b>MaterialUI</b> for example. But if needed, pure CSS is always with me! <br><br>Talking about Back-end now, I only know the VERY basics of <b>Node.js</b>, <b>Express</b> and <b>MongoDB/PostgreSQL</b>. I absolutely intend to learn more about this area in the future, but my focus for now is towards to become a more than decent front-end developer.
 
>So yeah, talking a little more about me, I consider myself a creative, humorous and fast learner person, always looking and working for the best, learning and absorbing everything as much as possible, practicing everyday!
