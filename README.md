<h4 align="center"> Yo! I'm Mateus Mascarelo, also known by the pseudonym of Kazyel, a current Computer Science student and in love with Front-end.</h4>

> <p align="justify">Nowadays, i'm working to be the best Junior Front-End Developer I can, putting together projects with frameworks like <b>React/Next.js</b>, utilizing <b>Javascript</b> while learning more about <b>Typescript</b> as possible. But I also know something or other about <b>Java</b> and <b>Python</b>, since these languages are primarily used in my college. <br><br>For stylization and component creation, I love working with extensions/frameworks of CSS like <b>SASS</b>, <b>TailwindCSS</b> & <b>Radix</b> for example. But if needed, pure CSS is always with me! <br><br>Talking about Back-end/APIs now, I only know the VERY basics of <b>Node.js</b>, <b>Express</b>, <b>MongoDB/PostgreSQL/Firebase/Prisma</b>. I absolutely intend to learn more about this area in the future as I really want to become a Full Stack, but my focus for now is to become more than decent on front-end side.
