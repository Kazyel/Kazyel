Yo! I'm Mateus Mascarelo, also known as Kazyel in the internet, a current Computer Science student and Front/Back-end enthusiast. 

My love with programming started since I was a kid, always got fascinated about everything that computers, internet and games could provide to the world. This passion, put together with my incessant will to solve problems, there would be no way to have doubts of what I want to be. So, yeah, i'm research and practicing, overcoming myself everyday and learning forever since then!

Today, i'm very happy working with Web Developing (ReactJS, NodeJS, Javascript, HTML, CSS, PHP), it's been a lot of fun making websites both for profissional projects or just for me so I can keep putting my knowledge in practice as I want. Somewhere in the future, I highly intend to start learning Game Development and/or Cybersecurity.
